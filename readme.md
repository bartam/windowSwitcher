Name and switch between defined windows.  Originally built to help multibox EQEMU.

## Features

* Create names for windows
* Start individual or all windows.

## Notes

* Unique names aren't enforced, but are recommended.  You may experience problems saving/deleting on items sharing the same name.

* You need to start the program through the application.  It won't detect pre-existing windows or windows opened in other methods.

* The application won't let you open multiple windows of the same name.

Pull requests are very welcome.  I'm not a .NET dev or a windows guy, so my deepest apologies.

If you're experiencing problems, create an issue and I'll do my best to help, but no promises.
